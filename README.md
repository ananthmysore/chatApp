# Chat App

Simple chat app built with Node JS and React JS

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Installing

Install npm on your machine (If you don't have yet)
Install mongo db and set the port to be running on 4000 (mongod)

cd chatApp
npm run-script start-server (Start the server) (8080 is your Node JS port)
npm start (Start the client) (3000/3001 will be your Client's port)

Mongo should be running by this time.

There is no seed data available at this time. 

```
until finished
```
